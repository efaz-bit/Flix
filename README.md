### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
    A couple of challenges I encountered when building the app mainly dealt with the terminal and how to direct through it. I wasn't very familiar with the commands so, installing cocoapods was a bit of an issue and that's what made me delay submitting my project on time. However, I was able to overcome this obstacle and had the app perform to its best ability.
